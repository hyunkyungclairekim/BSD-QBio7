abstract: "In this lesson, you will use ggplot2 to create effective
  data visualizations. The ggplot2 package is a powerful plotting
  interface that extends the base plotting functions in R. The main
  difference with Advanced Computing is that we take a more in-depth
  look at ggplot2 and plotting strategies."

Motivation
==========

*Why plot?* One reason is to gain insights from your data, what we
sometimes call "exploratory data visualization." Another reason is to
tell a story (say, in a research paper). Both will involve iteration
and refinement.

For these reasons, the *programmatic approach* is a powerful aapproach
data visualization. This will allow you to:

1. Create an endless variety of plots.

2. Reuse code to quickly create and revise plots.

In this tutorial we will explore the programmatic approach to plotting
using **ggplot2**, an increasingly popular package for creating
plots in R.

```{r knitr-options, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(results = "hide",collapse = TRUE,fig.height = 3,
                      fig.width = 3,fig.align = "center",fig.show = "hide")
```

Setup
=====

Download the tutorial materials to your computer, and make sure you
know where to find them.

Before starting the tutorial, I suggest quiting applications that are
not needed and other "clutter" to reduce distractions.

Launch RStudio. It is best if you start with a fresh workspace; you
can refresh your environment by selecting **Session > Clear
Workspace** from the RStudio menu. Also, make sure your R working
directory is the same directory containing the tutorial materials; you
can run `getwd()` and `list.files()` to check this.

If you have not already done so, install these packages:

```{r install-pkgs, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("cowplot")
install.packages("ggrepel")
install.packages("htmlwidgets")
install.packages("plotly")
```

Hands-on exericse: Do smaller dogs live longer?
===============================================

In this tutorial, we will make use some data that was made available
by the authors of a 2008 *Genetics* article,
"Single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based association mapping of dog
stereotypes." These data are stored in a CSV file that was included
with the rest of the tutorial materials.

Our aim is to investigate the anecdotal claim that dogs representing
breeds of small size (e.g., Chihuahuas) live longer than those from
larger-sized breeds (e.g., Saint Bernards).

Import the data into R
----------------------

By now, you should know how to import data from a CSV file. This code
reads the data from a CSV file and creates a data frame, `dogs`. (Make
sure your working directory is set to the location of these data,
otherwise R will not be able to find the file.)

```{r read-data}
dogs <- read.csv("dogs.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

A first look at the data
------------------------

After loading data into R for the first time, I recommend getting a
basic understanding of the data frame and its contents. Here are some
simple commands I often use:

```{r inspect-data}
nrow(dogs)
ncol(dogs)
names(dogs)
head(dogs)
tail(dogs)
summary(dogs)
```

*What different types of data are in this table?* Note that "aod" stands
for "age of death".

Let's take a closer look at the `shortcoat` column:

```{r inspect-shortcoat}
unique(dogs$shortcoat)
table(addNA(dogs$shortcoat))
```

The often overlooked scatterplot
--------------------------------

In this tutorial, we will learn about ggplot2 through one of the most
basic data visualizations: the scatterplot.
 
The scatterplot is easily overlooked because it is so simple, but it
can be one of the most effective ways to visualize scientific
data. Embellishments (e.g., varying colors, shapes, sizes, labels) can
produce stunning visualizations.

Scatterplots are typically used to investigate whether there is an
interesting—or surprising—relationship between two (continuous)
variables. But the scatterplot has many other uses.  For example, the
scatterplot can highlight problems with the data (e.g., "outliers").

Although simple, we can explore the key features of ggplot2 via the
scatterplot. Before doing this, though, let's first create a
scatterplot of weight vs. longevity using the base R function,
`plot`. (No special packages are used here.)

```{r basic-plot, fig.height=4, fig.width=3.5}
plot(dogs$weight, dogs$aod)
```

What story does this plot tell? Write code here to add this story to
the plot:

$$
\framebox[\textwidth]{\rule{0pt}{3em}}
$$

```{r basic-plot-with-title, echo=FALSE}
plot(dogs$weight, dogs$aod, main = "smaller dogs tend to live longer")
```

Our first ggplot2 (with ugly code)
----------------------------------

Now let's recreate this same scatterplot using ggplot2. The benefits
of ggplot2 over `plot` will not be immediately clear.

```{r scatterplot-1}
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(dogs, aes_string(x = "weight", y = "aod"))
p1 <- ggplot_add(geom_point(), p1)
```

Where is the plot? We need to call `print`, which tells R to draw the
plot to the screen:

```{r print-scatterplot}
print(p1)
```

Some slightly simpler code can accomplish the same thing:

```{r scatterplot-2a}
p1 <- ggplot(dogs, aes_string(x = "weight", y = "aod")) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r scatterplot-2b, echo=FALSE}
print(p1)
```

For the moment I want to focus on the "uglier" code because it
highlights better the key elements of a ggplot2 plot:

1. The first input is the data (stored in a data frame).

2. The second input is an "aesthetic mapping" that defines how columns
   are mapped to features of the plot (axes, shapes, colors, *etc*).

3. A "geom", short for "geometric object", specifies the type of
   plot. ggplot2 has an excellent on-line reference
   ([ggplot2.tidyverse.org][ggplot2]) explaining all the "geoms", from
   bar charts to contour plots, with code examples for each.

4. ggplot2 outputs a *ggplot object*, which can be drawn to the screen
   with `print` (or you can do other things with it).

The distinguishing feature of ggplot2 is that plots are created by
*adding layers*. This layering allows for infinite variety of plots to
be created. The layering approach means that ggplot2 is easily
extendible, and many R packages have been developed to enhance
ggplot2. (We will use two of these packages, ggrepel and cowplot.)

Some improvements
-----------------

Our plot can be improved. For example we can use the `labs` function
to add axis labels, and change how the points are plotted:

```{r scatterplot-improved}
p1 <- ggplot(dogs, aes_string(x = "weight", y = "aod")) +
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  labs(x = "body weight (lbs)", y = "longevity (years)")
```

```{r scatterplot-improved-2, echo=FALSE}
print(p1)
```

In what other ways can the plot can be improved? Add code for your
improved plot here:

$$
\framebox[\textwidth]{\rule{0pt}{6em}}
$$

A few other functions that you might find useful to improve your plot
are `scale_x_continuous`, `scale_y_continuous` and the `theme_`
functions.

```{r scatterplot-improved-3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(cowplot)
p1 <- ggplot(dogs, aes_string(x = "weight", y = "aod")) +
  geom_point(size = 2, shape = 21, color = "white",  fill = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,160,40)) +
  labs(x = "body weight (lbs)", y = "longevity (years)",
       title = "longevity vs. size") +
  theme_cowplot()
print(p1)
```

Save your work
--------------

This is a good point to save our work in an image file that can be
shared with others.

```{r save-plot}
ggsave("dogs.pdf", p1, height = 4, width = 4.5)
ggsave("dogs.png", p1, height = 4, width = 4.5)
```

*Question:* How does the PDF and PNG differ? When should you save the
plot as a PDF, and when should you save as a PNG?

Plot the best-fit line
----------------------

It has been estimated that an increase of 28 lbs in a dog's body
weight corresponds to about a 1-year drop in expected lifespan (with a
maximum lifespan of about 13 years). Let's see how well this estimate
agrees with the data by plotting the line that best fits these data
(the "least-squares" estimate).

```{r abline-1}
fit <- lm(aod ~ weight, dogs)
coef(fit)
```

Write code to add "best fit" line to the plot (and name the new plot
object "p2"):

$$
\framebox[\textwidth]{\rule{0pt}{3em}}
$$

```{r abline-2, echo=FALSE}
b <- coef(fit)
p2 <- p1 +
  geom_abline(color = "dodgerblue", linetype = "dashed",
              intercept = b[1], slope = b[2])
print(p2)
```

Now add another "abline" layer to compare our estimate against the
previous estimate (and name the new plot object "p3"):

$$
\framebox[\textwidth]{\rule{0pt}{3em}}
$$

```{r abline-3, echo=FALSE}
p3 <- p2 +
  geom_abline(color = "darkorange", linetype = "dashed",
              intercept = 13, slope = -1/28)
print(p3)
```

Notice how easy it was to add layers to the existing plot. Also notice
that this geom, like most geoms, has properties such as color and size
that can be adjusted.

Which breeds fit the trend, and which don't?
--------------------------------------------

It would be helpful if we could tell which breeds are being
plotted. Adding text to a ggplot is also done by adding a layer.

There's one catch here—there isn't enough real estate on the plot to
accommodate all the breed names. Let's try the "smart" function
`geom_text_repel` from the ggrepel package, which adds the labels in a
way that makes them more readable, and only adds them to the plot when
possible. Let's appreciate how simply this sophisticated plot is
created:

```{r scatterplot-with-labels}
library(ggrepel)
p4 <- p2 + geom_text_repel(mapping = aes_string(label = "breed"),
                           size = 2.5, color = "gray")
```

Notice that the labels are automatically redrawn as the plot is
resized—give it a try.

```{r scatterplot-with-labels-2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
print(p4)
```

$$

In-class exploration: a surprising subtlety with color
------------------------------------------------------

Other "aesthetics"—color, size, shape, *etc*—can also be used to tell
a visual story. In the last chapter of our exploratory data
visualization, we will visualize the `shortcoat` column with color,
and in the process discover a complication.

The `shortcoat` column, you may recall, had values of 0 or 1 (with a
few NAs).

```{r inspect-shortcoat-2}
dogs$shortcoat
```

In principle, varying the color of the points should be
straightforward.

```{r shortcoat-plot}
p5 <- ggplot(dogs, aes_string(x = "weight", y = "aod", label = "breed",
                              color = "shortcoat")) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_cowplot()
```

```{r shortcoat-plot-2, echo=FALSE}
print(p5)
```

What is the problem with this plot, and how can we fix it? (And is
it really a problem?) Write your code for the improved plot here:

$$
\framebox[\textwidth]{\rule{0pt}{6em}}
$$

```{r shortcoat-plot-3, echo=FALSE}
dogs$shortcoat <- factor(dogs$shortcoat)
p5 <- ggplot(dogs, aes_string(x = "weight", y = "aod", label = "breed",
                              color = "shortcoat")) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_cowplot()
```

<!-- This isn't a problem with the data itself. Rather, it is a
problem of *data representation*: the discrete-valued, or
*categorical* data are stored as a *continuously-valued* variable
(numeric). The key is to change how the data are represented, and
convert to a categorical variable, which in R is called a
"factor". This illustrates the more general point that careful data
preparation is important for creating good plots. -->

```{r shortcoat-plot-4, echo=FALSE}
print(p5)
```

A little more on color
----------------------

One the few complaints I have with ggplot2 is that the default colors
choices are poor. So you will often need to make adjustments to the
color scheme. One rule-of-thumb is that "warmer" colors (e.g., orange,
red) tends to draw the reader's attention. There are several good
resources on use of color in data visualization, and I will mention a
couple here: Color Brewer (https://colorbrewer2.org); and a short
article, "Color blindness", by Bang Wong in *Nature Methods*
(2011). For more extensive discussion, see "Fundamentals of data
visualization" by Claus Wilke. In our scatterplot, the best color
choice is less clear, so I will let you experiment with vdifferent
choices. To override the color defaults, add a "scale_color_manual"
layer, for example,

```{r shortcoat-plot-5}
p6 <- p5 +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick", "tomato"),
                     na.value = "skyblue")
```

```{r shortcoat-plot-6, echo=FALSE}
print(p6)
```

There are several different ways to specify colors. I prefer
specifying colours by name; to get the full list of named colors, run
`colors()`.

The function that controls the color of a discrete variable has an odd
name: `scale_color_manual`. This is because, in ggplot2, all methods
that control the mapping of variables to colors, shapes, sizes, axes,
*etc*, start with `scale_`.

Obviously, there is much more to ggplot2. But once you are comfortable
with these basic elements, you will find that almost everything else
in ggplot2 is a variation of what we covered in this lesson.

*Optional exercise:* Try varying shape instead of color. Use
`scale_shape_manual` to select the shapes. Running `plot(0:23,pch =
0:23)` will give you all the shapes to choose from.

*Optional exercise:* Try varying point size instead of color. What
 problem do you run into, and what is the solution?

Programming challenge: Mapping the genetic basis of physiological and behavioral traits in outbred mice
=========================================================================================================

In this programming challenge, you will use simple visualizations to
gain insight into biological data.

You are working in a lab studying studying the genetics of
physiological and behavioral traits in mice. The lab has just
completed a large study of mice from an outbred mouse population,
"CFW" ("Carworth Farms White"). The aim of the study is to identify
genetic contributors to variation in behaviour and musculoskeletal
traits.

**Note:** These challenges are roughly ordered in increasing level of
complexity. Do not be discouraged if you have difficulty completing
every one.

Collaboration strategy
----------------------

Before diving into the problems, first agree on a collaboration
strategy with your teammates. Important aspects include communication
and co-ordination practices, and setting goals and deadlines. How will
your team collaborate on code, and share solutions? (Consider online
resources such as Etherpad or the UofC-hosted Google Drive.) The aim
is not just to complete the challenges, but also to do
collaboratively; all team members should be included, and should
have the opportunity to contribute and learn from each other.

Instructions
------------

+ Locate the files for this exercise on your computer (see "Materials"
  below).

+ Make sure your R working directory is set to the same directory
  containing the tutorial materials; use `getwd()` to check this.

+ Some of the programming challenges require uploading an image file
  containing a plot. Use `ggsave` to save your plot as a file. Any
  standard image format (e.g., PDF, PNG) is acceptable.

+ No additional R packages are needed beyond what you used in the
  hands-on exercises above.

Materials
---------

+ **pheno.csv:** CSV file containing physiological and behavioral
phenotype data on 1,219 male mice from the CFW outbred mouse
stock. Data are from [Parker *et al*, 2016][cfw-paper]. Use
**readpheno.R** to read the phenotype data from the CSV file into a
data frame. After filtering out some of the samples, this script
should create a new data frame, `pheno`, containing phenotype data on
1,092 samples (rows).

+ **hmdp.csv:** CSV file containing bone-mineral density measurements
taken in 878 male mice from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel
(HMDP). Data are from [Farber *et al*, 2011][hmdp-paper]. To load the
data into your R environment, run this code:

    ```{r read-hdmp-data}
    hmdp <- read.csv("hmdp.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    ```

    This will create a data frame, `hmdp`, containing BMD data on
    878 mice (rows).

+ **gwscan.csv:** CSV file containing results of a "genome-wide scan"
for abnormal BMD. Association *p*-values were computed using
GEMMA 0.96. To read the results of the genome-wide scan, run
the following code:

    ```{r read-gwscan-results}
    gwscan <- read.csv("gwscan.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    gwscan <- transform(gwscan, chr = factor(chr, 1:19))
    ```

    This will create a data frame, `gwscan`. Each row of the data
    frame is a genetic variant (a single nucleotide polymorphism, or
    "SNP"). The columns are chromosome ("chr"), base-pair position on
    the chromosome ("pos"), and the *p*-value for a test of
    association between variant genotype and trait value
    ("abnormalBMD"). The value stored in the "abnormalBMD" column is
    $-\log_{10}(P)$, where $P$ is the *p*-value.

+ **geno_rs29477109.csv:** CSV file containing estimated genotypes at
  one SNP (rs29477109) for 1,038 CFW mice. Use the following code to
  read the genotype data into your R environment:

    ```{r read-genotypes}
    geno <- read.csv("geno_rs29477109.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    geno <- transform(geno, id = as.character(id))
    ```

    This will create a new data frame, `geno`, with 1,038 rows
    (samples). The genotypes are encoded as "dosages"---that is, the
    expected number of times the alternative allele is observed in the
    genotype. This will be an integer (0, 1, 2), or a real number
    between 0 and 2 when there is some uncertainty in the estimate of
    the genotype. For this SNP, the reference allele is T and the
    alternative allele is C. Therefore, dosages 0, 1 and 2 correspond
    to genotypes TT, CT and CC, respectively (genotypes CT and TC are
    equivalent).

+ **wtccc.png:** Example genome-wide scan ("Manhattan plot") from
Fig. 4 of the [WTCCC paper][wtccc-paper]. The *p*-values highlighted
in green show the regions of the human genome most strongly associated
with Crohn's disease risk.

A couple tips
-------------

+ Some "geoms" you may find useful: `geom_point`, `geom_histogram`,
  `geom_boxplot`.

+ In some cases it may be useful to convert to a *factor*.

Part A: Exploratory analysis of muscle development and conditioned fear data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your first task is to create plots to explore the data.

1. A basic initial step in an exploratory analysis is to visualize the
distribution of the data. It is often convenient if the distribution
is normal, or "bell shaped".

    + Visualize the empirical distribution of tibialis anterior (TA)
      muscle weight (column "TA") with a histogram. Units are mg.
	  *Hint:* Try using function `geom_histogram`.

    + Is the distribution of TA weight roughly normal? Are there mice
      with unusually large or unusually small values ("outliers")? If
      so, how many "outliers" are there? (Unusually small or large
      values can lead to misleading results in some statistical
      tests.)

2. It is also important to understand relationships among measured
quantities. For example, the development of the tibia bone (column
"tibia") could influence TA muscle weight. Create a scatterplot
(`geom_point`) to visualize the relationship between TA weight and
tibia length. (Tibia length units are mm.) Based on this plot, what
can you say about the relationship between TA weight and tibia length?
Quantify this relationship by fitting a linear model, before and after
removing the outlying TA values. (*Hint*: Use the `lm` and `summary`
functions. See also the "r.squared" return value in
`help(summary.lm)`.)

3. The "AvToneD3" column contains data collected from a behavioral
test called the "Conditioned Fear" test.

    + Visualize the empirical distribution of AvToneD3 ("freezing to
      cue") with a histogram. Is the distribution of AvToneD3
      approximately normal?

    + Freezing to cue is a proportion (a number between 0 and 1). A
      common way to obtain a more "normal" quantity is to
      transform it using the "logit" function[^1]. Visualize the
      empirical distribution of the logit-transformed phenotype. Is
      the transformed phenotype more "bell shaped"? After the
      transformation, do you observe unusually small or unusually
      large values?

    + A common concern with behavioral tests is that the testing
      devices can lead to measurement error. It is especially a
      concern when multiple devices are used, as the devices can give
      slightly different measurements, even after careful calibration.
      Create a plot to visualize the relationship between
      (transformed) freezing to cue and the device used ("FCbox"
      column). *Hint:* Try a boxplot (`geom_boxplot`). Based on this
      plot, does the apparatus used affect these behavioral test
      measurements?

[^1]: R code: `logit <- function(x) log((x + 0.001) / (1 - x + 0.001))`

Part B: Exploratory analysis of bone-mineral density data
---------------------------------------------------------

Now you will examine data on bone-mineral density (BMD) in mice. This
is a trait that is important for studying human diseases such as
osteoporosis (units are $\mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{cm}^2$).

+ Plot the distribution of BMD in CFW mice (see column "BMD"). What
is most notable about the distribution?

+ Compare these data against BMD measurements taken in a "reference"
mouse population, the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel. To compare, create
two histograms, and draw them one on top of the other. What difference
do you observe in the BMD distributions? For a correct comparison, you
will need to account for: (1) BMD in CFW mice was measured in the
femurs of male mice only; (2) BMD in HMDP mice was recorded in
$\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^2$. *Hints:* Functions `xlim` and `labs` from
the ggplot2 package, and `plot_grid` from the cowplot package, might
be useful for creating the plots. The `binwidth` argument in
`geom_histogram` may also be useful.

Part C: Mapping the genetic basis of osteopetrotic bones
--------------------------------------------------------

A binary trait, "abnormal BMD", was defined that signals whether an
individual mouse had "abnormal", or osteopetrotic, bones. It takes a
value of 1 when BMD falls on the "long tail" of the distribution (BMD
greater than 90 $\mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{cm}^2$), otherwise zero.

GEMMA was used to carry out a "genome-wide association study" (GWAS)
for this trait; that is, support for association with abnormal BMD was
evaluated at 79,824 genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms,
or "SNPs") on chromosomes 1--19. At each SNP, a *p*-value quantifies
the support for an association with abnormal BMD.

1. Your first task is to get an overview of the association results by
creating a "Manhattan plot". Follow as closely as possible the
provided prototype, **wtccc.png**, which shows a genome-wide scan for
Crohn's disease. (Don't worry about highlighting the strongest
*p*-values in green.) *Hints:* Replicating some elements of this
plot may be more challenging than others, so start with a simple plot,
and try to improve on it. Recall the adage that creating plots
requires relatively little effort *provided the data are in the right
form*---consider adding appropriate columns to the `gwscan` data
frame. Functions from the ggplot2 package that you may find useful for
this exercise include `geom_point`, `scale_color_manual` and
`scale_x_continuous`.

    + In your plot, you should observe that the most strongly
      associated SNPs cluster closely together in small regions of the
      genome. This is common---it is due to a genetic phenomenon known
      as linkage disequilibrium (LD). It is a consequence of low
      recombination rates between markers in small populations. How
      many SNPs have "strong" statistical support for association with
      abnormal BMD, specifically with a $-\log_{10}\mbox{{\em
      p}-value} > 6$? How many distinct regions of the genome are
      strongly associated with abnormal BMD at this *p*-value
      threshold?

    + What *p*-value does a $-\log_{10}\mbox{{\em p}-value}$ of 6
      correspond to?

    + Using your plot, identify the "distinct region" (this is called
      a "quantitative trait locus", or QTL) with the strongest
      association signal. What is, roughly, the size of the QTL in
      Megabases (Mb) if we define the QTL by base-pair positions of
      the SNPs with $-\log_{10}\mbox{{\em p}-value} > 6$? Using the
      [UCSC Genome Browser][ucsc-browser], get a rough count of the
      number of genes that are transcribed in this region. Within this
      QTL, [Parker *et al*, 2016][cfw-paper] identified *Col1a1* as a
      candidate BMD gene. Was this gene one of the genes included in
      your count? *Hint:* All SNP positions are based on NCBI Mouse
      Genome Assembly 38 (mm10, December 2011).

2. Your next task is to visualize the relationship between genotype
and phenotype. From the genome-wide scan of abnormal BMD, you should
find that rs29477109 is the SNP most strongly associated with
abnormal BMD. Here you will look closely at the relationship between
BMD and the genotype at this SNP. In developing your visualization,
consider that:

     + The samples listed in the phenotype and genotype tables are not
       the same. So you will need to align the two tables to properly
       show analyze the relationship. *Hint:* Function `match` could be
       useful for this.

     + The genotypes, stored in file **geno_rs29477109.csv**, are
       encoded as "dosages" (numbers between 0 and 2). You could start
       with a scatterplot of BMD vs. dosage. But ultimately it is more
       effective if the genotypes (CC, CT and TT) are
       plotted instead. *Hints:* In effect, what you need to do is
       convert from a continuous variable (dosage) to a discrete
       variable (genotype). One approach is to create a `factor`
       column from the "dosage" column. For dosages that are not
       exactly 0, 1 or 2, you could simply round to the nearest whole
       number. A boxplot is recommended; see function `geom_boxplot`.

    Based on your plot, how would describe (in plain language) the
    relationship between the genotype and BMD?

An interactive plot
-------------------

Here is an example of a plot that allows the data to be explored
*interactively*:

```{r scatterplot-plotly, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(htmlwidgets)
p <- plot_ly(data = dogs, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
             x = ~weight, y = ~aod, color = ~shortcoat,
             text = ~sprintf("%s\n (%0.1f lbs, %0.1f years)", breed, weight, aod),
             marker = list(line = list(color = "white", width = 1), size = 9),
             hoverinfo = "text", width = 600, height = 500)
p <- layout(p,
            xaxis = list(title = "weight (lbs)"),
            yaxis = list(title = "longevity (years)"),
            hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = "white", bordercolor = "black"))
saveWidget(p, "dogs.html", selfcontained = TRUE)
```

[Plotly][plotly] is a powerful package for creating interactive plots,
with an interface similar to ggplot2.
